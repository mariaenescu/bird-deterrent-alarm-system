# bird-deterrent-alarm-system

A farmer is facing the problem of birds destroying crops. To solve this issue, I decided to build an automatic alarm system designed to scare birds away without harming them. The system uses a separate power supply from a PC, an Arduino board as the microcontroller, with a PCF8574 for pin expansion, an analog light sensor to determine whether it is day or night, four ultrasonic distance sensors to detect the distance between the birds and the crops from multiple angles, an RGB LED for visual signaling, a speaker to emit warning sounds, and an LCD display to show relevant information.
