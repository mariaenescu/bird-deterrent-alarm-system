# bird-deterrent-alarm-system
A farmer faces crop damage caused by birds. To solve this, I built an automatic alarm system using an Arduino, PCF8574 for pin expansion, light and ultrasonic sensors, an RGB LED, a speaker, and an LCD. It detects birds and scares them away without harm, using visual and sound signals, powered by a separate PC supply.
